# wordlist

I created this script as I was learning russian and needed a fast way to keep track of all the new words and meanings. It is intended for anyone who is at the first stages of learning any language.

After downloading the source code into your directory you can run it with the command: <pre><code>```python srcwordlist.py```</code></pre> The program itself will guide you further.

The script uploads each word and meaning into an Excel file. At the beginning you are gonna be presented with a list of all the Excel files in your directory. You can create a new one.

Each time your Excel file exceeds 50 items it will be recommended to start a new one. This is my personal preference to not have anything more than 50 new words to study at a time.

You can choose to export everything into a JSON file or a normal TXT file. I formatted the TXT so that you can possibly put it inside Quizlet's "Import" feature when creating a new set of flashcards.
